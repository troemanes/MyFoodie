**MyFoodie** is my first learning app project. This project was developed while following a course to learn the basics of Kotlin and XML features. As a result, approximately 80% of the codebase is based on the course material. However, the course did not cover all the features of the app and contained some errors, which I improved to make the app work more effectively and completely.

To enhance functionality, I integrated a RESTful API to fetch meal data dynamically, providing users with up-to-date and diverse content directly from the server. This feature ensures that the app remains interactive and content-rich.

In the future, I might redesign the UI to make it more modern and professional, similar to today's app standards. Additionally, I may refactor and update the entire project for potential publication on the Play Store. Until then, this project will remain open-source.
